## Off Topic Minecraft server stat grabber and displayer

This repository will have tools to gather, prepare, and display various stats from the Off Topic Minecraft server. In the final state it will include a python script to be run at an interval of your choosing that will extract the necessary data to JSON files, which will then be displayed on a webpage using JavaScript.

Current functionality displays data from pre-prepared JSON files.

## Usage:
- Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/AtlasV1224/PufferchicksStats`.
- Map a page to the `PufferStats.html` file.

`index.html` is included for systems that require it, it redirects to `PufferStats.html` only and can be safely removed if needed.
